# Charity Organizations Analysis Using Neural Networks

---
# :one: Overview.

The purpose of this exercise is to develop, with the use of neural networks, a binary classifier that is capable of determining whether or not a particular application would be successful in obtaining funding from a charitable organization known as ##Alphabet Soup##.

We were given a CSV file by the business team at Alphabet Soup that included the names of more than 34,000 groups that have been successful in obtaining funding throughout the years. The dataset has a number of columns, each of which captures a different piece of metadata pertaining to one of the organizations.

---
# :two: Results.

The columns of the data set are:

* `EIN` and `NAME` ‚Äî Identification columns
* `APPLICATION_TYPE` ‚Äî Alphabet Soup application type
* `AFFILIATION` ‚Äî Affiliated sector of industry
* `CLASSIFICATION` ‚Äî Government organization classification
* `USE_CASE` ‚Äî Use case for funding
* `ORGANIZATION` ‚Äî Organization type
* `STATUS` ‚Äî Active status
* `INCOME_AMT` ‚Äî Income classification
* `SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS` ‚Äî Special consideration for application
* `ASK_AMT` ‚Äî Funding amount requested
* `IS_SUCCESSFUL` ‚Äî Was the money used effectively

## Data Preprocessing
* What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
* What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
* What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
* How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
* Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
* What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
