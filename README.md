# Charity Organizations Analysis Using Neural Networks

---
# :one: Overview.

The purpose of this exercise is to develop, with the use of neural networks, a binary classifier that is capable of determining whether or not a particular application would be successful in obtaining funding from a charitable organization known as ##Alphabet Soup##.

We were given a CSV file by the business team at Alphabet Soup that included the names of more than 34,000 groups that have been successful in obtaining funding throughout the years. The dataset has a number of columns, each of which captures a different piece of metadata pertaining to one of the organizations.

---
# :two: Results.

The columns of the data set are:

* `EIN` and `NAME` ‚Äî Identification columns
* `APPLICATION_TYPE` ‚Äî Alphabet Soup application type
* `AFFILIATION` ‚Äî Affiliated sector of industry
* `CLASSIFICATION` ‚Äî Government organization classification
* `USE_CASE` ‚Äî Use case for funding
* `ORGANIZATION` ‚Äî Organization type
* `STATUS` ‚Äî Active status
* `INCOME_AMT` ‚Äî Income classification
* `SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS` ‚Äî Special consideration for application
* `ASK_AMT` ‚Äî Funding amount requested
* `IS_SUCCESSFUL` ‚Äî Was the money used effectively

## Data Preprocessing

* **What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?**

<p align="center">
 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98360572/175748463-2d59b516-a27a-43fe-afdb-692898415a6d.png" width="50%" height="50%">

Target, T, is the correct or desired value for the respose associate to one input, X. Usually, this value will be compared with the output (the response of the neural network), Y to guide the learning process involving the weight changes. The difference between he desired result (the target, T) and the actual output, Y, is the error.  The objective of training the neural network is to minimize the error.

In our case, the objective is that the Neural Network be able to predict if an organization is going to be successful or not, using the funds received so the `IS_SUCCESSFUL` column contains the target variable. Target variables are also known as dependent variable and we are using this variable to train our model.

* **What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?**

Input values are defined as features for the model and are also referred to as independent variables. All the columns in the CSV except the target variable `IS_SUCCESSFUL` and the ones we dropped ‚Äî `EIN` and `NAME` are included in those variables.


* **What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?**

The columns `EIN` and `NAME` do not contain data that gives additional information to the model.  They would just add noise to the problem and were therefore removed from the dataset using the `drop` function from Pandas.

In the same way, variables with too many unique values whould be removed.  In our example, the column `ASK_AMT` has `8747` unique values, so this variable should also be eliminated, or at least "binned" in order to reduced the number of variables that the model will have to deal with.

But, what is Binning?

Binning is a technique that accomplishes exactly what it sounds like. It will take a column with continuous numbers and place the numbers in ‚Äúbins‚Äù or categories based on ranges that we determine. This will give us a new categorical variable feature.


## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

* How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

* Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

* What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
